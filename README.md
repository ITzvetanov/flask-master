Project Title: 
- Flask

Project Description:
- This project aims to demonstrate proficiency building and using complete devops practice scenario. 

It utilizes the following platform tools and technologies and includes features such as:
- Linux: open-source operating system, command-line interface, support for a wide range of hardware, stability and security.
- AWS (Amazon Web Services): cloud computing platform, offers a wide range of services including compute, storage, and databases, scalability and flexibility, security and compliance.
- Terraform: infrastructure as code tool, provision and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers, versioning and collaboration.
- Helm: package manager for Kubernetes, manage and deploy applications and services, versioning and rollback of releases.
- Python: high-level programming language, easy to read and write, extensive libraries and frameworks, support for multiple programming paradigms.
- Docker: containerization platform, package and deploy applications and their dependencies, portable and efficient.
- Jenkins: open-source automation server, automate the building, testing, and deployment of software, integration with a wide range of tools and plugins.
- Kubernetes: open-source container orchestration system, automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, high availability and scalability.

The project is organized using the following best practices for building project structure/architecture: 
- Source code: this includes the front-end and back-end code of the application, typically stored in a version control system like Git.
- Build pipeline: this includes the steps to build and test the application, typically using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or Travis CI.
- Containerization: this includes the process of packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, typically using a tool like Docker.
- Configuration management: this includes the management of environment-specific configurations, typically using a tool like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef.
- Orchestration: this includes the process of deploying and managing the containers in a cluster, typically using a tool like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- Monitoring and logging: this includes the process of monitoring the application's performance and logging events, typically using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
- Scaling and high availability: this includes the process of ensuring the application can handle increased traffic and recover from failures, typically using techniques like load balancing and auto-scaling.
- Security: this includes the process of securing the application and infrastructure, typically using techniques like network segmentation, firewalls, and encryption.

This project follows key components of Waterfall development methodology.
