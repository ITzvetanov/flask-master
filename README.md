Project Title: 
- Flask v.1.00

Project Description:
- This project aims to demonstrate proficiency building and using complete devops practice scenario. 

It utilizes the following platform tools and technologies and includes features such as:
- Linux: open-source operating system, command-line interface, support for a wide range of hardware, stability and security.
- AWS (Amazon Web Services): cloud computing platform, offers a wide range of services including compute, storage, and databases, scalability and flexibility, security and compliance.
- Terraform: infrastructure as code tool, provision and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers, versioning and collaboration.
- Helm: package manager for Kubernetes, manage and deploy applications and services, versioning and rollback of releases.
- Python: high-level programming language, easy to read and write, extensive libraries and frameworks, support for multiple programming paradigms.
- Docker: containerization platform, package and deploy applications and their dependencies, portable and efficient.
- Jenkins: open-source automation server, automate the building, testing, and deployment of software, integration with a wide range of tools and plugins.
- Kubernetes: open-source container orchestration system, automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, high availability and scalability.

The project is organized using the following best practices for building project structure and architecture: 
- Source code: this includes the front-end and back-end code of the application, stored in a version control system GitHub.
- Build pipeline: this includes the steps to build and test the application, using a CI/CD tool Jenkins.
- Containerization: this includes the process of packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, using Docker.
- Configuration management: this includes the management of environment-specific configurations, using Terraform.
- Orchestration: this includes the process of deploying and managing the containers in a cluster, using Kubernetes.
- Monitoring and logging: this includes the process of monitoring the application's performance and logging events, using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Scaling and high availability: this includes the process of ensuring the application can handle increased traffic and recover from failures, using AWS techniques like load balancing and auto-scaling.
- Security: this includes the process of securing the application and AWS infrastructure, using network segmentation, firewalls, and encryption techniques.

This project follows key components of Waterfall development methodology.
